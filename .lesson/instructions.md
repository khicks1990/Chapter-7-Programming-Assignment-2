# Instructions  

 Write a program that simulates a Magic 8 Ball, which is a fortune-telling toy that displays a random response to a yes or no question. On the left, you will find a text file named 8_ball_responses The file contains 12 responses, such as “I don’t think so,” “Yes, of course!,” “I’m not sure,” and so forth. The program should read the responses from the file into an array or ArrayList object. It should prompt the user to ask a question, and then display one of the responses, randomly selected from the array or ArrayList object. The program should repeat until the user is ready to quit.
